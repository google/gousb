Package gousb provides an low-level interface to attached USB devices.

A Short Tutorial

A Context manages all resources necessary for communicating with USB
devices.
Through the Context users can iterate over available USB devices.

The USB standard defines a mechanism of discovering USB device functionality
through descriptors. After the device is attached and
initialized by the host stack, it's possible to retrieve its descriptor
(the device descriptor). It contains elements such as product and vendor IDs,
bus number and device number (address) on the bus.

In gousb, the Device struct represents a USB device. The Device structâ€™s Desc
field contains all known information about the device.

Among other information in the device descriptor is a list of configuration
descriptors, accessible through Device.Desc.Configs.

The USB standard allows one physical USB device to switch between different
sets of behaviors, or working modes, by selecting one of the offered configs
(each device has at least one).
This allows the same device to sometimes present itself as e.g. a 3G modem,
and sometimes as a flash drive with the drivers for that 3G modem.
Configs are mutually exclusive, each device
can have only one active config at a time. Switching the active config performs
a light-weight device reset. Each config in the device descriptor has
a unique identification number.

In gousb a device config needs to be selected through Device.Config(num).
It returns a Config struct that represents the device in this particular configuration.
The configuration descriptor is accessible through Config.Desc.

A config descriptor determines the list of available USB interfaces on the device.
Each interface is a virtual device within the physical USB device and its active
config. There can be many interfaces active concurrently. Interfaces are
enumerated sequentially starting from zero.

Additionally, each interface comes with a number of alternate settings for
the interface, which are somewhat similar to device configs, but on the
interface level. Each interface can have only a single alternate setting
active at any time. Alternate settings are enumerated sequentially starting from
zero.

In gousb an interface and its alternate setting can be selected through
Config.Interface(num, altNum). The Interface struct is the representation
of the claimed interface with a particular alternate setting.
The descriptor of the interface is available through Interface.Setting.

An interface with a particular alternate setting defines up to 30 data
endpoints, each identified by a unique address. The endpoint address is a combination
of endpoint number (1..15) and endpoint directionality (IN/OUT).
IN endpoints have addresses 0x81..0x8f, while OUT endpoints 0x01..0x0f.

An endpoint can be considered similar to a UDP/IP port,
except the data transfers are unidirectional.

Endpoints are represented by the Endpoint struct, and all defined endpoints
can be obtained through the Endpoints field of the Interface.Setting.

Each endpoint descriptor (EndpointDesc) defined in the interface's endpoint
map includes information about the type of the endpoint:

- endpoint address

- endpoint number

- direction: IN (device-to-host) or OUT (host-to-device)

- transfer type: USB standard defines a few distinct data transfer types:

--- bulk - high throughput, but no guaranteed bandwidth and no latency guarantees,

--- isochronous - medium throughput, guaranteed bandwidth, some latency guarantees,

--- interrupt - low throughput, high latency guarantees.

The endpoint descriptor determines the type of the transfer that will be used.

- maximum packet size: maximum number of bytes that can be sent or received by the device in a single USB transaction.
and a few other less frequently used pieces of endpoint information.

An IN Endpoint can be opened for reading through Interface.InEndpoint(epNum),
while an OUT Endpoint can be opened for writing through Interface.OutEndpoint(epNum).

An InEndpoint implements the io.Reader interface, an OutEndpoint implements
the io.Writer interface. Both Reads and Writes will accept larger slices
of data than the endpoint's maximum packet size, the transfer will be split
into smaller USB transactions as needed. But using Read/Write size equal
to an integer multiple of maximum packet size helps with improving the transfer
performance.

Apart from 15 possible data endpoints, each USB device also has a control endpoint.
The control endpoint is present regardless of the current device config, claimed
interfaces and their alternate settings. It makes a lot of sense, as the control endpoint is actually used, among others,
to issue commands to switch the active config or select an alternate setting for an interface.

Control commands are also ofen use to control the behavior of the device. There is no single
standard for control commands though, and many devices implement their custom control command schema.

Control commands can be issued through Device.Control().
